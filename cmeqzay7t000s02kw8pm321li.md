## 📌 1. Recap: Pod

* A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
    
* Pods wrap one or more containers.
    
* Pods are **ephemeral**:
    
    * If a Pod crashes, it won’t be recreated automatically.
        
    * This makes Pods unsuitable for production as-is.
        

---

## 📌 2. What is a ReplicaSet?

* Ensures that a specified number of **replicas of a Pod** are running at all times.
    
* If a Pod fails or is deleted, the ReplicaSet creates a new one.
    
* Handles **scaling** (up/down replicas).
    
* **But:** ReplicaSet doesn’t support **rolling updates**.
    

## 3\. Deployment

* A higher-level controller that manages ReplicaSets.
    
* Handles
    
    * Rolling updates (upgrade containers without downtime).
        
    * Rollbacks (go back to previous version).
        
    * Scaling (up/down easily).
        
* ✅ The most common way to run apps in Kubernetes. 👉 Think of ReplicaSet as: **Pod + self-healing + scaling**
    

# 🚀 Scaling and Rolling Updates in Kubernetes

## 📌 Scaling in Kubernetes

### 🔹 What is Scaling?

Scaling means **increasing or decreasing the number of Pods** in a Deployment or ReplicaSet.

* **Horizontal Scaling** → Increase or decrease the number of Pod replicas.
    
* **Vertical Scaling** → Adjust CPU/Memory resources of Pods (less common, requires pod restart).
    

Kubernetes makes scaling simple and allows both manual and automatic scaling.

---

### 🔹 Manual Scaling with `kubectl`

Suppose you have a Deployment named `nginx-deployment` with 2 replicas.

* Check deployments:
    

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

* Scale to 5 replicas:
    

```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=5
```

* Verify the pods:
    

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

* Scale back to 3 replicas:
    

```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=3
```

---

### 🔹 Auto Scaling with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

Kubernetes can automatically scale Pods based on CPU or memory usage using **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**. Enable autoscaling:

```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment nginx-deployment --min=2 --max=10 --cpu-percent=70
```

This configuration means:

* Minimum 2 Pods, maximum 10 Pods.
    
* If average CPU usage per Pod exceeds 70%, Kubernetes will add more Pods.
    

Check HPA:

```bash
kubectl get hpa
```

---

## 🔄 Rolling Updates in Kubernetes

### 🔹 What is a Rolling Update?

A Rolling Update gradually replaces old Pods with new ones without downtime.

* Old Pods are terminated after new Pods are running.
    
* Ensures the application remains available during the update.
    
* Default update strategy in Kubernetes is RollingUpdate.

### 🔹 Example: Deploy Nginx

Let’s say you deploy an Nginx app (v1.14):

```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Apply the deployment:

```plaintext
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

---

**🔹 Performing a Rolling Update** Update the Nginx version:

```plaintext
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
```

Check rollout progress:

```plaintext
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

Watch Pods update one by one:

```plaintext
kubectl get pods -w
```

**🔹 Rollback if Something Goes Wrong** Undo the update:

```plaintext
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```

Check history of rollouts:

```plaintext
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
```

---

### ✅ Summary

* Scaling ensures your app can handle more/less traffic by changing Pod counts.
    
* Rolling Updates let you upgrade your app version with zero downtime.
    
* Kubernetes also supports rollback if something breaks.
    
* Together, these features make applications highly available and resilient.
